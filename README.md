# HitsoundChanger

A cool program to change hitsounds. Easy and intuitive.

HitsoundChanger.exe has all the necessary files and all that, just download that and you're good. If you want to be critical of how bad I am at programming, go ahead. I need to learn.

Credit for creating the exe goes to http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/, it's cool.
